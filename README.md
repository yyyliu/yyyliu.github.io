### Note

Development happens in the dev branch. After you're ready to deploy, copy everything in the `build` folder, and `index.html`, to the master branch (I mean manually).

Some commands:
```bash
# get started
npm install 

# build development
npm run dev

# build production
npm run build

# start a testing server
npm run start
```
